Today I want to show you how to make your own wiki interface with Google Drive and Docs.

We have a lot to cover so I will be going quickly, but the code will be available on github after the talk.

I'll be using a library called Preact, which is a lightweight version of React. It's a great way to do interactive web development without a build step.

We are going to start by rendering a Google Doc, then creating a recursive tree component. If you've never seen a recursive component before they are very cool.

Let's go ahead and start with a blank slate.

I'm starting with some html markup that initializes our api key. I am not going to show you to set up an api key today, but you can find that information in the Google Drive API documentation.

Tree
---
- New file: Tree.js
- Request
- Render files in an unordered list
- It is only the first level of files, use recursive component if it's a folder
- Nested tree will make another request and that will render a nested tree
  - Show a deeply nested example
