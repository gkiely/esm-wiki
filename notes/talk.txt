About me
---
I'm a frontend engineer turned founder. I built youneedawiki.com, wiki based application built on Docs and Drive.

Overview
---
- How to make your own wiki interface
- Using preact, lightweight version of react. Doesn't require a build step.
- Code will be available on github
- I am not going into auth or setting up an api key today, but you can find that in the Google Drive API documentation.
- Public folders and files
- Start by rendering google doc, then recursive tree component.
- Here is the drive folder, contains some tutorials and faqs, we want to render that


index.html
---
- Here is some html markup that initializes our api key
- Import map

main.js
---
- Waits until gapi has loaded and mounts components

Page
---
- Request


Tree
---
- Request
- Render files
- It is only the first level of files
- Recursion
  - Nested tree will make another request and that will render a nested tree
- Show a deeply nested example
