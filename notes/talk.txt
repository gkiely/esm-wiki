About me
---
I'm a frontend engineer. I built youneedawiki.com, wiki based application built on Docs and Drive.

Overview
---
- How to make your own wiki interface
- Using preact, lightweight version of react. Doesn't require a build step.
- Code will be available on github
- Start by rendering google doc, then recursive tree component.
- Starting with some html markup that initializes our api key.
- I am not going into auth or setting up an api key today, but you can find that in the Google Drive API documentation.
- Here is the drive folder, contains some tutorials and faqs, we want to render that

Page
---
- Static markup
  - Title
  - Content
- Make request to a static ID
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VDTyWNVCspD2mMC-IQQUtgf8HyLUe37C6G87TheqJhI
- Make the request dynamic, also include folder ID in URL
  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NqCSiMuEfPfaHTumR_rX6J8zo7ygjx8q


Tree
---
- Static markup
- Request
- Render files in an unordered list
- It is only the first level of files, use recursive component if it's a folder
- Nested tree will make another request and that will render a nested tree
  - Show a deeply nested example
